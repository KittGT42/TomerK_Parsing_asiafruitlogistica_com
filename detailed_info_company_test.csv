2020年3月，云南八方农业科技发展有限公司正式成立，由墨西哥里瓦斯生产公司、汪志哲（中国台湾）、云南正锋阁农业科技发展有限公司、青岛尤尼帕克商贸有限公司、Agawa Takumi（墨西哥籍）共同出资，注册资金436万美元。

公司组建了一支农学专业人才研发团队，开展引种、试种、扩种研究，进行基地育苗、移栽定植，授粉、水肥等方面的工作。
公司的股东之一——墨西哥GlobalFrut公司，家族三代人都在专注牛油果的生产种植，国外专家通过到实地教学、视频与邮件往来，为基地牛油果的生长提供了全程技术指导，与基地的同事们共同探索牛油果在中国因地制宜的本土化种植模式。

基地为分批定植，在2020定植下的第一批牛油果，已在2023年10月正式上市！八方牛油果果形端正、饱满，果肉呈黄绿色，入口细腻绵密，在舌尖轻轻一抿，仿佛在吃一口醇厚的绿色奶油，细细回味，还有一股浓郁的坚果香气在口腔环绕。从外形、颜色再到口感与香气，八方牛油果的品质都高于进口牛油果。
